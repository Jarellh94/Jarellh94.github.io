					<h1>Our Founder's Story</h1>
					<p>For seven consecutive years of my childhood life, my mother, 2 brothers and I were in and out of different people’s homes, motels, shelter. Simply put, we were homeless. No place to call our own. Our car was constantly filled with with the belongings that we could take with us. Whenever we were able to take all of our belongings out of the car because we would be staying with someone for longer than a week, it felt like heaven to me. I got to pretend that the person’s house was mine. And I hated leaving, because I didn’t know if that would be the day my mom would say “well guys tonight we will be sleeping in the car.” I didn’t know what was next. I believe my faith in God first started to sprout during this time, because I was constantly praying that we would have somewhere to stay for the night and food to eat. And sure enough, He always came through. At times, I never thought we would have a place to call our own, and others, I thought that life couldn’t be any worse than this. Then January 2004 happened...  WE MOVED INTO OUR OWN HOME…and we all had our own room! No longer did I have to worry about if my mom would pick me up, or what motel we would be staying in, or if we would eat dinner. We finally had a place to call home. Since then, I have graduated Summa Cum Laude with my Bachelor’s of Science Degree in Mathematics Education from Central State University. I have taught as an Adjunct Math Instructor  at Howard Community College and am a middle school math teacher in Maryland. Based on my situation, statically I shouldn’t have even graduated high school. But God saw differently. And I am forever grateful for the blessing He has poured onto my family and I. My goal is to serve as a reminder and a living testimony to those currently living on the streets, to not give up hope. Homelessness does not have to be the end of their story.  I am living proof of that it doesn't have to be the end of their story. </p>
